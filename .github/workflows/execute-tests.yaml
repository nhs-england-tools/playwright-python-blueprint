# This workflow is triggered manually and allows the user to specify the environment and test marker to run.
# It is functional, however will not work against BCSS test environments until we configure some self-hosted
# GitHub runners, as the GitHub-hosted runners are based outside of the UK so get blocked by the WAF on the
# environments.
