# Utility Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the utility classes provided as part of this blueprint.  By default, these will not run when using the blueprint unless `-m "utils"` is specified as an option when executing tests.

> NOTE: You only need to copy this directory if you transfer the blueprint code into your own repository and you want to ensure that utility classes continue to behave as expected.
